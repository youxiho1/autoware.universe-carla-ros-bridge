CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:4 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findros_environment.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "ros_environment", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ros_environment"
  with any of the following names:

    ros_environmentConfig.cmake
    ros_environment-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ros_environment" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "ros_environment_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "ros_environment" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.
